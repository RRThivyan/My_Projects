Project Name - RiceLeaf disease detection
Rice plant is susceptible to diseases that may affect the quantity and quality of rice production. Detection of these diseases by the farmers will require a great knowledge about the various disease and how to identify them visually.
Monitoring these diseases, their occurrences and frequencies are very important for early detection of the affected plants, their timely treatment, and most importantly, for planning future strategies to prevent the diseases to minimize the losses.
CNN is an algorithm of deep learning techniques that has been successfully invoked for handling computer vision issues such as picture classification, object segmentation, and image analysis.
CNN has been used to address the classification of Rice leaf diseases accurate detection and classification of rice leaf disease.
The dataset provided contains 120 jpg images of disease-infected rice leaves. The images are grouped into 3 classes based on the type of disease. There are 40 images in each class. Classes

Leaf smut : small black linear lesions on leaf blades, leaf tips may turn grey and dry.

Bacterial blight : elongated lesions near the leaf tips and margins, and turns white to yellow and then grey due to fungal attack.

Brown spot : dark brown colored and round to oval shaped lesions on rice leaves.

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:-Create a model which can classify the three major attacking diseases of rice plants like leaf blast, bacterial blight and brown spot.

Task3:- Analyze various techniques like Data Augmentation, etc and create a report on that.
