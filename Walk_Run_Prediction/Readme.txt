Walk Run Prediction

The "walkrunclass" dataset is related to a classification problem where the objective is to predict whether an activity is a "walk" or a "run" based on certain features or attributes. This dataset contains instances of both walking and running activities, with accompanying features that describe each activity. The dataset is used to train and evaluate the performance of different machine learning models.
